# Sudoku

A Sudoku game written with [_React.js_](https://reactjs.org/).

## How do I install this?

Just clone the repository, install the dependencies using [_yarn_](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) and run the start script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pramser/sudoku.git

yarn install

yarn start
```

## Why did you build this?

I wanted to challenge myself to building a game using [_React.js_](https://reactjs.org/). Being both simple and one of my favorites, I figured Sudoku would be a good starting point. Since I'm not calculating the board configurations I can mostly focus on laying out the game and coming up with a scoring system and some decent mechanics.

## Huh. Are there plans for more?

Yeah, hopefully. My goal is to add some various features, like different board configurations (triangles, pentagons), a marathon mode, and maybe even traps. When I figure out how best to score the game I'll add in something to facilitate that as well.
